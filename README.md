A search for a spin-0 Dark Matter (DM) mediator decaying to a pair of DM candidates produced in association with a pair of top quarks in the all-hadronic channel. This analysis uses a columnar framework to process
input tree-based [NanoAOD](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/WorkBookNanoAOD) files using the [coffea](https://coffea-hep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [scikit-hep](https://scikit-hep.org/) Python libraries.
